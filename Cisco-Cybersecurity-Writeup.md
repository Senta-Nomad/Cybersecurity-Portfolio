# Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity Write-Up

I recently completed *Cisco's Introduction to Cybersecurity* course, a pivotal step in launching my cybersecurity career.
This course illuminated the escalating risks and severity of cyber threats, from data breaches to ransomware, impacting inviduals, organizations, and governments.
I gained insight into the global shortage of cybersecurity professionals, a critical challenge driving the need for skilled experts.
Through Cisco's structured cirriculum, I explored foundational concepts like network security, threat detection, and risk mitigation, building a strong base for future learning.
The course's practical approach, including real-world case studies, deepened my understanding of how cyberattacks exploit vulnerabilities and how professionals safeguard systems.
I'm grateful to Cisco for providing this accessible, high-quality course, which has equipped me with essential knowledge and confidence to pursue advanced certifications and
contribute to a safer digital world. This milestone marks the beginning of my journey in cybersecurity, and I'm excited to share my progress and projects
on Github as I grow in this dynamic field.
